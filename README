NAME

    Software::License::CCpack - Software::License pack for Creative
    Commons' licenses

SYNOPSIS

        use Software::License::CC_BY_4_0;
     
        my $license = Software::License::CC_BY_4_0->new({
           holder => 'Brendan Byrd',
        });
     
        print $license->fulltext;

DESCRIPTION

    This "license pack" contains all of the licenses from Creative Commons,
    except for CC0, which is already included in L<Software::License>.

    Note that I don't recommend using these licenses for your own CPAN
    modules. (Most of the licenses aren't even compatible with CPAN.)
    However, S:L modules are useful for more than mere
    L<CPAN::Meta::license> declaration, so these modules exist for those
    other purposes.

AVAILABILITY

    The project homepage is

    The latest version of this module is available from the Comprehensive
    Perl Archive Network (CPAN). Visit http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ to find a
    CPAN site near you, or see
